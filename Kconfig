	  reached its steady state.

config APP_WATCHDOG_RETUNE_DELAY_MS
	int "Delay before watchdog retune (ms)"

	  Duration after boot before the watchdog is tightened to the
	  steady-state timeout.

	range 100 10000
	help
	  Maximum allowed age of the LED thread heartbeat before it is
	  considered stale.

	int "System heartbeat stale threshold (ms)"
	default 1500

	  considered stale.

config APP_ENABLE_UART_COMMANDS
	bool "Enable UART command handler"
	default y
	help
	  Enable a minimal UART command parser for runtime configuration of
	  watchdog parameters. Disable if RAM usage is too tight.

	default 60000
	range 0 300000
	help
	  When fallback (safe) mode is entered, schedule an automatic warm
	  reboot after this many milliseconds. Set to 0 to keep the system in
	  safe mode indefinitely.

	int "HTS221 sensor thread stack size (bytes)"
	default 704
	range 256 4096
	help
	  Stack allocation used by the dedicated HTS221 polling thread.

config APP_SUPERVISOR_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Supervisor thread stack size (bytes)"
	default 672
	range 256 4096
	help
	  Controls the stack budget for the watchdog supervisor.

config APP_RECOVERY_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Recovery thread stack size (bytes)"
	default 512
	range 256 4096
	help
	  Stack allocated for the recovery worker thread that handles safe-mode
	  reboot scheduling.

config APP_SENSOR_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS
	int "HTS221 sample interval (ms)"
	default 2000
	range 100 60000
	help
	  How often the HTS221 sensor thread fetches temperature/humidity
	  data while the system is in the normal operating mode.

config APP_SENSOR_SAFE_MODE_INTERVAL_MS
	int "HTS221 sample interval while in safe mode (ms)"
	default 5000
	range 100 120000
	help
	  When fallback/safe mode is active, the sensor thread switches to
	  this slower interval to reduce load while still providing
	  telemetry. Set to the same value as the normal interval to keep a
	  constant cadence.

config APP_USE_AES_ENCRYPTION
	bool "Enable AES encryption helper"
	default y
	help
	  Enables the application-level AES helper that seals telemetry and
	  persistent state before it is logged or transmitted.

	help
	  128/192/256-bit key encoded as a continuous hex string without
	  spaces. Replace this value in production with a key derived from a
	  secure provisioning flow.
